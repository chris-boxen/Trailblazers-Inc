## Active — Template Build

Templates to build or refactor. Work through these in any order.

- [x] `single-athlete.php` — apply base classes; update queries for TEC meets
- [x] `single-coach.php` — apply base classes
- [ ] `single-athletic_event.php` — apply base classes; update queries
- [ ] `taxonomy-sport.php` — apply base classes; update queries for TEC
- [ ] `archive-athlete.php` — refactor tables to ul/li list system
- [ ] `archive-athletic_meet.php` — refactor tables to ul/li list system (or confirm archived)
- [ ] `archive-athletic_record.php` — refactor tables to ul/li list system
- [ ] `tribe/events/single-event.php` — TEC theme override (meet single)

---

## Backlog — Known Bugs (post-launch)
- [ ] **RF CC spinner — no visible progress** — ~27 seconds with no
  intermediate state shown. Add "Processing your payment..." status message.
- [ ] **GF Stripe + GPPA Payment Element conflict** — RF field 57 workaround
  in place. Monitor Gravity Wiz ticket.
- [ ] **`gform_disable_notification` filter** — "TB Registration Receipt - Paid"
  fires on failed CC payments. Add filter to suppress when payment status
  is not Paid.
- [ ] **Duplicate Stripe webhooks** — clean up stale sandbox webhooks.

---

## Backlog — UX Issues (non-blocking polish)

- [ ] WP subscriber dashboard — needs content and layout updates
- [ ] Handbook note inside nested athlete form is redundant with Page 3
- [ ] Optional donations field — choice labels missing amounts
- [ ] `.tb-single-header-secondary-section` — handbook button is full-width
  on right column; confirm or constrain width

---

## Deferred — Schema / Data

- [ ] Athletic Results and Athletic Records data import
- [ ] Confirm `publicly_queryable` is false on Family, Application, Enrollment,
  and Athletic Physical CPTs
- [ ] Decide whether TEC `tribe_events_cat` needs sport sub-categories
- [ ] Additional Singlets (Returning) — future: derive from nested form entries
- [ ] Revisit payment abstraction if workflow becomes more complex
- [ ] Revisit theme folder naming (space in folder name)
- [ ] Add `template-parts/` structure when templates grow complex enough
- [ ] Consider proper single-site email customization
