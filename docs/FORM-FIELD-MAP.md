# Trailblazers — GravityForms Field Map
**Version:** 2.3
**Season:** 2026 XC
**Status:** Ready to build

## Conventions

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **GF Type** | Gravity Forms field type |
| **Maps to** | CPT → ACF field name |
| **How set** | `user` = entered by submitter / `hidden` = invisible field / `hook` = set programmatically / `pre-pop` = GPPA pre-populated / `read-only` = GPPA pre-populated, non-editable |
| **Notes** | Conditional logic, GravityPerks dependencies, or implementation warnings |

---

## Registration Entry Point

`/registration/` uses `[tb_reg_router]` shortcode. Detects user state and routes:

| User state | Result |
|---|---|
| Not logged in | Shows Create Account + Log In buttons |
| Logged in, no Family post | Redirects to `/registration/new-families/` |
| Logged in, Family post, no active-season Enrollment | Redirects to `/registration/returning-families/` |
| Logged in, Family post, active-season Enrollment exists | Shows already-registered message from options |

Each child page is protected by user-state guards in the `[tb_reg_form]` shortcode handler (`inc/registration-helpers.php`). Logged-out users and users on the wrong form type are redirected to `/registration/`.

## Form 1: 2026 Registration — New Family (ID 101)

## Nested Form: Register Returning Athlete (Form 103)

**Used by:** Returning Family Page 2 (returning athletes only)
**Permanent / reusable** — no season-specific content. Built once, reused every season.

Field 1 (Family Post ID) is a hidden GPPA anchor that self-resolves via `family post where meta_account_user = current_user:ID`. The nested form is self-contained and does not require a reference to any parent form field.

| Field | GF Type | Maps to | How set | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(Family Post ID)* | Hidden (Field 1) | *(GPPA anchor)* | GPPA | Queries family post where `meta_account_user = current_user:ID` → returns post ID. Anchors Field 2 athlete selector. |
| Select Athlete | Select (Field 2) | `enrollment` → `athlete` | user | GPPA choices: Athlete posts where `meta_family = gf_field:1` AND `meta_account_status = Active`. Label = `post_title`, value = post ID. |
| **— Athlete Identity —** | Section | | | Fields 4–7 are read-only, GPPA-populated from selected Athlete post. |
| First Name | Text | *(display only)* | **read-only** | GPPA values: Athlete post where `ID = gf_field:2` → `meta_first_name`. GW Read Only required. |
| Last Name | Text | *(display only)* | **read-only** | GPPA values → `meta_last_name`. |
| Gender | Radio | *(display only)* | **read-only** | GPPA values → `meta_gender`. |
| Date of Birth | Date | *(display only)* | **read-only** | GPPA values → `meta_dob`. |
| Grade | Select | `enrollment` → `grade` | user | Required. Entered fresh each season. 1st–12th. |
| Participation Type | Radio | `enrollment` → `participation_type` | user | Athlete / Sibling Runner. May change season to season (sibling runner can become full athlete). |
| **— Eligibility — Athlete —** | Section | | | Conditional: Participation Type = Athlete |

## Waiver Text (Page 4 — both parent forms)

```html
<p>As a parent or legal guardian of the above named student-athlete(s). I give
permission for his/her participation in athletic events and the physical evaluation
for that participation. I understand that this is simply a screening evaluation and
not a substitute for regular health care. I also grant permission for treatment
deemed necessary for a condition arising during participation of these events,
including medical or surgical treatment that is recommended by a medical doctor.
I grant permission to nurses, trainers and coaches as well as physicians or those
under their direction who are part of athletic injury prevention and treatment, to
have access to necessary medical information. I know that the risk of injury to my
child/ward comes with participation in sports and during travel to and from play
and practice. I have had the opportunity to understand the risk of injury during
participation in sports through meetings, written information or by some other
means. My signature indicates that to the best of my knowledge, my answers to the
above questions are complete and correct. I understand that the data acquired
during these evaluations may be used for research purposes.</p>

## Open Items

- [ ] **Stripe confirmation hook:** Confirm which hook updates `payment_status` to `Paid` — likely `gform_stripe_fulfillment` or `gform_stripe_after_payment_intent_succeeded`. Wire in `inc/gravity-helpers.php`.
- [ ] **Handbook URL:** Active season post `handbook` field is a placeholder. Update before opening registration.
- [ ] **Policy Compliance links:** Athlete eligibility checkbox references Eligibility, Code of Conduct, and Dress & Appearance Guidelines pages. Confirm URLs are current before go-live.
- [ ] **GW Read Only dependency:** Field 1 (Family Name) on Returning Family form and identity fields on Register Returning Athlete nested form require GW Read Only (GravityPerks) to enforce non-editability. Confirm plugin is installed and active.
- [ ] **Confirmation page structure (Open Question 12):** Q12 is still unresolved. Current GF confirmations redirect to `/registration/confirmation/?type=paid` and `/registration/confirmation/?type=offline`. Update once Q12 is decided.
- [ ] **Additional Singlets (Returning):** The manual count field on RF Page 5 (Field 47) asks the parent to enter how many returning athletes selected a new singlet. This is minor UX friction — the parent must mentally count. Future improvement: derive this count from the nested form entries.
