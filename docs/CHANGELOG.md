# CHANGELOG

## 2026-03 (TEC integration + schema restructure)

### Integrated The Events Calendar Pro — retired athletic_meet CPT
The Events Calendar Pro (TEC) is now part of the project stack. After architectural
review, `athletic_meet` has been retired as a custom CPT. `tribe_events` now serves
as the single anchor post for all meet data.

**Rationale:** Maintaining a parallel `athletic_meet` post alongside a TEC event for
every XC meet added admin overhead without architectural benefit. A single `tribe_events`
post per meet is cleaner — TEC handles public calendar display natively, and ACF fields
on `tribe_events` handle the internal data layer.

**What changed:**
- `post_type_tb_athletic_meet` — deleted from ACF, JSON retired to archive
- `group_tb_athletic_meet` — deleted from ACF, JSON retired to archive
- `single-athletic_meet.php` — moved to `_archived-templates/`
- `archive-athletic_meet.php` — moved to `_archived-templates/`
- New ACF field group `group_tb_tec_event` created on `tribe_events`:
  - `season` — Post Object → `athletic_season`
  - `results_status` — Select (Future / Pending / Available)
- `group_tb_athletic_result` — `meet` field target changed from `athletic_meet`
  to `tribe_events`
- TEC event slug configured as `/event/`
- `tribe_venue` adopted for venue management
- TEC archive (`/event/`) to be redirected to a custom query page via
  `template_redirect` hook in `inc/cpt-hooks.php`
- Single meet display to be built as TEC theme override:
  `tribe/events/single-event.php`

**Non-calendar meets (T&F / SportsYou coaches):**
All `tribe_events` meet posts are published regardless of public calendar visibility.
The `calendar_show_meets` season flag controls whether meets surface on the public
schedule. Published status is required for ACF post object queries to resolve.

**Two concepts named "event" — critical distinction:**
- `athletic_event` — canonical event *definition* (5K, 100m, Long Jump). Unchanged.
- `tribe_events` — a meet *instance* (specific date, location, season). Replaces `athletic_meet`.
This distinction must be maintained in all code comments and documentation.

### Added per-season feature flags to Athletic Season CPT
New True/False fields added to `group_tb_athletic_season`:

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `calendar_show_meets` | Whether upcoming meets publish to TEC public calendar |
| `calendar_show_practices` | Whether practices publish to TEC public calendar |
| `results_enabled` | Whether results are surfaced in templates (display control only) |
| `link_milesplit` | Whether Milesplit athlete links are rendered |
| `link_athletic_net` | Whether AthleticNet athlete links are rendered |

New Textarea field: `results_unavailable_message` — shown in templates when
`results_enabled = false`. Falls back to a generic message if blank.

Flags control display only. They do not prevent data entry. An admin can flip
`results_enabled` at any time to start or stop surfacing results for a season.

**Naming note:** The field was intentionally named `results_enabled` rather than
`track_results` to avoid semantic ambiguity with "track and field results."

---

### Resolved: `results_enabled` naming
Confirmed `results_enabled` as the canonical field name. `track_results` was
rejected because in a track and field context it reads as a noun phrase
("track-and-field results") rather than the intended verb phrase ("record/monitor
results"). Documented in SCHEMA.md.

## 2026-03 (continued from previous entries)

### Designed GravityForms registration form architecture
Replaced the previous multi-form, multi-user approach with a simplified architecture
reflecting the new single-household-user model. Key decisions:
- Registration entry point is a WP page with two buttons, not a form
- New Family and Returning Family are separate parent forms (5 pages each)
- Single combined nested form for Athlete + Sibling Runner registration
  (participation type radio drives conditional eligibility blocks)
- `Register New Parent`, `Register Returning Athlete`, and `Register Sibling Runner`
  from the 2025 form set are eliminated
- Both forms require login; Returning Family locates the Family post via
  `account_user = get_current_user_id()` — no user-visible Family ID
- Active season populated via `gform_field_value` filter reading `tb_active_season_id`
  site option
- Handbook page (Page 3) pulls handbook URL dynamically from the Athletic Season CPT
  `handbook` link field via `gform_field_value`
- Payment page includes optional processing contribution as a native GF Product field
  (radio buttons: No thanks $0 / Help a little $3 / Cover processing $5 / Pay it
  forward $10); folds into GF order total natively with no custom code
- Full field map documented in `docs/FORM-FIELD-MAP.md`

### Added participation_type to Athlete CPT
Added `participation_type` select field (Athlete / Sibling Runner, allow null) to
`group_tb_athlete.json`. Denormalized convenience field for archive filtering. Source
of truth for season-specific type remains Enrollment. Updated by enrollment creation
hook. Empty values treated as Athlete in templates and JS filters. See SCHEMA.md.

### Added payment_amount to Application CPT
Added `payment_amount` number field (step 0.01, prepend $) to
`group_tb_application.json`. Set by hook from GF order total at submission. Reflects
combined registration fee plus any optional processing contribution donation.

### Resolved: account_status vs participation_type distinction
Confirmed Alumni belongs in `account_status`, not `participation_type`. The two
fields answer different questions — lifecycle state vs. season enrollment type.
Documented in SCHEMA.md.

### Determined build sequence for registration system
Data population must precede form build; form build must precede hook code (hooks
require real GF field IDs). Parked GravityForms work pending data population thread.
